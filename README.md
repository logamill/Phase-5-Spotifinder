## Description 

Spotifinder offers a fun and interactive way for users to visualize their Spotify listening data over a variety of different time periods ranging from all-time to ~6 months to ~4 weeks. Users can see various hidden analytical categories including: danceability, liveness, acousticness, energy, popularity and valence (how happy or sad a song is) and see how they match with other users based on those categories.
